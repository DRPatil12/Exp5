## 🎯 Aim:

# Study of dictionary in Python.
 
---

## 🧰 Functions Used:

The following types of functions are commonly used throughout the project:

* 🔹 **Input Functions** – To accept user or system input
* 🔹 **Processing Functions** – To perform calculations and logical operations
* 🔹 **Conditional Functions** – `if`, `if‑else`, `switch` for decision making
* 🔹 **User‑Defined Functions** – To improve modularity and readability
* 🔹 **Built‑in Functions** – Language‑specific utility functions

---

## 📘 Theory:

### 🔹 Core Concepts Covered

* **Variables and Data Types**: Used to store, manage, and manipulate data according to the needs of each problem.
* **Input and Output Operations**: Allow smooth interaction between the user and the program, making execution dynamic.
* **Conditional Statements**: Decision‑making constructs (`if`, `if‑else`, `nested conditions`) guide the program flow based on given conditions.
* **Looping Constructs**: Iterative statements (`for`, `while`, `do‑while`) help in reducing code repetition and improving efficiency.
* **Functions and Modularity**: Breaking the program into user‑defined functions improves readability, reusability, and maintenance.
* **Algorithmic Logic**: Each problem is solved using a predefined algorithm to ensure systematic and error‑free execution.

### 🔹 Code‑Wise Working

* Programs follow a **logical and sequential approach** from input acquisition to output display.
* Each step is clearly implemented to maintain simplicity and clarity.
* Proper initialization and condition checking help avoid runtime errors.
* The correctness of theoretical logic is verified through obtained results.

Overall, this theory strengthens the connection between **conceptual knowledge and practical coding**, promoting a clear understanding of structured programming.
