#**EXPERIMENT 5 : Study of Dictionary in Python**

##*AIM*: **To study the dictionary data type in Python and perform basic operations such as creation, accessing values, updating and removing elements, handling duplicate keys, and solving real-life problems using dictionaries.**

*THEORY*:
A dictionary in Python is a built-in data type used to store data in the form of key–value pairs. Each key in a dictionary is unique and is used to access its corresponding value. Dictionaries are unordered, mutable, and indexed by keys instead of positions. Dictionaries are created using curly braces {}, with keys and values separated by a colon (:). Keys can be of immutable data types such as strings, numbers, or tuples, while values can be of any data type. If duplicate keys are used, Python stores only the latest value for that key.

Various built-in functions and methods such as len(), type(), update(), pop(), values(), and get() are used to manipulate dictionary elements. Dictionaries are widely used in real-world applications like storing student records, product details, login systems, and data analysis.

*ALGORITHM*:

*Program 1: Creation and display of Dictionary*

     Start the program.
     Create a dictionary using key–value pairs.
     Store it in a variable.
     Display the dictionary using print().

*Program 2: Accessing a Value Using Key*

     Start the program.
     Create a dictionary.
     Access a value using its key inside square brackets.
     Display the retrieved value.

*Program 3: Handling Duplicate Keys*

    Start the program.
    Create a dictionary with duplicate keys.
    Assign different values to the same key.
    Print the dictionary.
    Observe that the latest value replaces the old one.

*Program 4: Finding Length of Dictionary*

    Start the program.
    Create a dictionary.
    Use the len() function to count key–value pairs.
    Display the result.

*Program 5: Finding Type of Dictionary*

    Start the program.
    Create a dictionary.
    Use the type() function.
    Display the result.

*Program 6: Adding or Updating Elements in Dictionary*

    Start the program.
    Create a dictionary.
    Use the update() method to add or modify key–value pairs.
    Display the updated dictionary.

*Program 7: Retrieving Values from Dictionary*

    Start the program.
    Create a dictionary with student details.
    Access a specific value using its key.
    Display the value.

*Program 8: Removing an Element from Dictionary*

    Start the program.
    Create a dictionary.
    Use the pop() method to remove a key–value pair.
    Display the updated dictionary.

*Program 9: Updating Product Details*

    Start the program.
    Create a dictionary containing product names and prices.
    Update the price of a product using update().
    Display the updated product list.

*Program 10: Login Authentication Using Dictionary*

     Start the program.
     Create a dictionary of usernames and passwords.
     Accept username and password from the user.
     Compare input with stored values using get().
     Display login success or failure message.

*Program 11: Finding Topper Using Dictionary*

    Start the program.
    Create a dictionary containing student names and marks.
    Use max() with key=dictionary.get to find highest marks.
    Display the topper’s name and marks.

*CONCLUSION:*

Thus, the experiment successfully demonstrated the use of Python dictionaries for storing and managing data in key–value format. Operations such as accessing, updating, deleting values, and solving real-life problems like authentication systems and result analysis were performed. This experiment helps in understanding efficient data handling and practical applications of dictionaries in Python programming.
