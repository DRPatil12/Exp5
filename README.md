## 🧰 Functions Used

The following types of functions are commonly used throughout the project:

* 🔹 **Input Functions** – To accept user or system input
* 🔹 **Processing Functions** – To perform calculations and logical operations
* 🔹 **Conditional Functions** – `if`, `if‑else`, `switch` for decision making
* 🔹 **Looping Functions** – `for`, `while`, `do‑while` for repetition
* 🔹 **User‑Defined Functions** – To improve modularity and readability
* 🔹 **Built‑in Functions** – Language‑specific utility functions

## 📘 Theory:

This project emphasizes the **practical implementation of programming fundamentals** by translating theoretical concepts directly into working code. The theory behind each problem is grounded in core programming principles that are essential for building efficient and readable programs.

### 🔹 Core Concepts Covered

* **Variables and Data Types**: Used to store and manipulate data efficiently based on problem requirements.
* **Input and Output Operations**: Enable interaction between the user and the program, forming the basis of dynamic execution.
* **Conditional Statements**: Decision‑making constructs (`if`, `if‑else`, `nested conditions`) control the logical flow of the program.
* **Looping Constructs**: Repetition mechanisms (`for`, `while`, `do‑while`) are used to optimize code and reduce redundancy.
* **Functions and Modularity**: User‑defined functions help divide the program into manageable blocks, improving reusability and clarity.
* **Algorithmic Logic**: Each solution follows a predefined algorithm to ensure correctness and systematic execution.

### 🔹 Code‑Wise Working

* Programs follow a **top‑down approach**, starting from input handling to final output generation.
* Logical steps are implemented sequentially to maintain clarity.
* Error‑free execution is ensured by proper initialization and condition checking.
* Theoretical logic is validated through practical outputs.

Overall, the theory bridges the gap between **conceptual understanding and real‑world coding**, enabling effective problem solving through structured programming.
