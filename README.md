## 🧰 Functions Used

The following types of functions are commonly used throughout the project:

* 🔹 **Input Functions** – To accept user or system input
* 🔹 **Processing Functions** – To perform calculations and logical operations
* 🔹 **Conditional Functions** – `if`, `if‑else`, `switch` for decision making
* 🔹 **Looping Functions** – `for`, `while`, `do‑while` for repetition
* 🔹 **User‑Defined Functions** – To improve modularity and readability
* 🔹 **Built‑in Functions** – Language‑specific utility functions

## 📘 Theory:

This project is designed to provide an in‑depth understanding of how **programming concepts are applied step‑by‑step in actual code**. The theory section explains how each part of the program works internally and how logical thinking is translated into executable statements. Every problem is solved by carefully analyzing the requirements and implementing them using structured programming techniques.

### 🔹 Variables and Data Types

Variables act as storage locations in memory where data values are saved during program execution. Appropriate data types are selected based on the nature of the input and output. Correct use of variables ensures accurate calculations and smooth data handling throughout the program.

### 🔹 Input and Output Operations

Input statements are used to receive data from the user or predefined sources. Output statements display the processed results in a clear and readable format. These operations form the foundation of program interaction and help verify whether the logic is functioning correctly.

### 🔹 Conditional Statements (Decision Making)

Conditional statements such as `if`, `if‑else`, and nested conditions are used to control the flow of execution. Based on given conditions, the program decides which block of code should be executed. This allows the program to handle multiple cases efficiently and ensures logical correctness.

### 🔹 Looping Constructs (Iteration)

Loops such as `for`, `while`, and `do‑while` are used to repeat a set of instructions until a specific condition is met. Looping reduces redundancy, improves efficiency, and makes the code more organized. Proper initialization, condition checking, and updating are essential to avoid infinite loops.

### 🔹 Functions
Functions are used to divide the program into smaller, manageable sections. User‑defined functions improve code readability, reusability, and debugging. Each function performs a specific task and returns control to the main program after execution.

### 🔹 Algorithmic and Logical Flow

Before writing the code, a clear algorithm is defined for each problem. The algorithm outlines the logical steps required to solve the problem. This logical flow is then converted into code statements, ensuring systematic execution and minimizing errors.

### 🔹 Code Execution Process

1. The program begins execution from the main function.
2. Required variables are declared and initialized.
3. Input values are accepted.
4. Logical conditions, loops, and functions are applied as per the algorithm.
5. Final results are displayed using output statements.
6. Program execution terminates successfully.
